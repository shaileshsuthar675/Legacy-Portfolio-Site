                in the global risk and compliance position
                exerted
                considerable
                work and time to prepare the daily report for the examination of the market, capital, and several
                other elements. In light of these considerations, the objective of this project was to develop a
                one-of-a-kind solution for all teams to generate their manual reports with a single click, so that
                key members of staff can devote more time to value-added activities that improve business
                insights and drive better decisions.

            Each daily risk report was made by hand, and it took about five to six hours per day to do so. There
            were
            a lot of formatting issues with this report, such as text and cell colour coding, bold text, italic
            text, cell merging, and calculations that used two or more Excel files. The goal of this whole
            automation was to develop a unique Python programme that anyone could use to automate their
            business report in less time. Considering that I made a Python interface for Peru and Colombia
            report and a unique library name called “PyautoPDF”.</p>
