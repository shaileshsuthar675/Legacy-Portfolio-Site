            With the help of python integrated automated process it takes on an average 98.22 second to
            generate the both report which includes Peru as well as Colombia. In this process of
            automation, I was taking an intermediate excel file which includes the dynamic path of all the
            source file from different-different share drive location as well as attached file in outlook mail.
            After crosschecking the dynamic path of all the source file, run the python code and it will
            capture all the specified information as per the requirement came from user.

            After capturing all
            the data into a specific location of consolidated excel file into a specified sheet at the specific
            cell, assign the formatting to it which includes colour coding of cell or a text, table creation,
            merging the cells, boding condition, italic condition, orientation, size of the text and so on via
            the library name called PyautoPDF using an installation from "pip install PyautoPDF" in your
            command prompt. Then completion of the formatting operation in each sheet of consolidated
            excel file, run the next line of python code for generating a word file and then at the end PDF
            file out of it which includes all the information of sheet by sheet at page by page in PDF file.</p>
